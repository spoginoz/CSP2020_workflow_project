Project file for CSP 2020 tutorial

<p>Chose from one of two datasets: </p>
<li>Zoo Animal Life Expectancy</li>
> Researchers based at Chicago’s Lincoln Park Zoo have published “life expectancy estimates for hundreds of vertebrate species based on carefully vetted studbook data from North American zoos and aquariums.” Their dataset includes “sex-specific median life expectancies as well as sample size and 95% confidence limits for each estimate.”

***
<li>Book Ratings from Book Crossings</li>
> In 2004, computer scientist Cai-Nicolas Ziegler scraped (with permission) 433,000 numeric ratings of 186,000 books by 78,000 users on the book-tracking website BookCrossing. For most users, the data includes their stated city and age. [h/t Ningshan Zhang, Kyle Schmaus, and Patrick O. Perry]
